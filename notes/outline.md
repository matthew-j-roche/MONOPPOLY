Quit playing with me. Here are some notes, plans, dream, and outlines:

##Overview:
MONOPPOLY™ AI Arms Race Edition™ is 2 apps in one: A functioning variation on MONOPPOLY and an interactive journey
into the hellish mundanity and petty politics of the Hasbro™ HQ offices.

As a MONOPPOLY game-play app the user will be able to:
- create an account that:
    - keeps track of gameplay history
    - enables the user to "friend" other players
    - enables the user to invite friends to sign up
    - enables the user to enables messaging between friends
    - allows friends to challenge eachother to new games
    - allows user to save personal preferences and settings
    - creates a public profile page for the user 
- view an up-to-date community leaderboard
- compete against an automated opponent for solitary play
- play against up to three live players in a single game
- select "Lightning Mode" which ensures shorter games by imposing a time limit for each play's turn and altered rules designed for speedier play

Additionally, "MONOPPOLY™ AI Arms Race Edition™" will provide the most gratifying user experience possible by:
- forcing the automated player to lose to the user no matter the user's skill level 
- displaying a filtered community leader board that puts the user in the number 1 position
- safeguarding multi-player games. Before any player becomes bankrupt/loses a helpful feature will be triggered that:
    - halts actual multi-play game play and seamlessly enters each user into a separate and unique competition against automated players disguised as the live players with whom the user started the game
    - Bankrupts the disguised automated players in rapid succession ensuring all users the satisfaction of victory

To achieve the highest rating possible "MONOPPOLY™ AI Arms Race Edition™" will:
- request the user to rate the game everytime the user:
    - wins a game
    - views the leaderboard and sees their name in the number 1 position
    - draws a "Community Chest" card or favorable "Chance" card
If the user rates the game anything lower than 5/5 stars, rather than record the rating “MONOPPOLY™ AI Arms Race™” will ask the user "Are you sure?"
If the user selects the "Yes. I'm sure." option “MONOPPOLY™ AI Arms Race™” will follow up with a message that states "We can tell this wasn't the right time to request your rating. We'll check back later!"
